## vroombot

The web interface of [my React mileage widget](http://jesswray.com/vroombot).  I text it my odometer reading at fillups and the page displays statistics about my gas mileage.

If the display numbers look strange, I texted it some creative data while it was too cold to drive. ‚ùÑÔ∏è üå®Ô∏è ‚òÉÔ∏è

The AWS Lambda functions are in the [vroombot_lambda](https://github.com/wrayjs/vroombot_lambda) and [vroombot_fetch](https://github.com/wrayjs/vroombot_fetch) repos.
